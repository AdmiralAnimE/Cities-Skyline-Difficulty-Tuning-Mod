# Cities-Skyline-Difficulty-Tuning-Mod

Eight levels of difficulty. Also allows separate tuning of each difficulty factor.

No changes in the gameplay, except costs, demand, and level up requirements.

Difficulty level and other custom parameters can be set in the game options.
Can be changed during the game, but the cost values in the hint popups will show the old values.
Exit to the Main Menu, change the difficulty options, and load the game again.

## Difficulty Levels
- **Easy.** Easier than vanilla. All costs halved. Free relocation of the service buildings. Level up requirements decreased. Demand never drops to zero. Have fun with it!
- **Normal.** Almost the same as vanilla.
- **Medium.** Just a little harder than vanilla.
- **Hard.** Close to the Hard Mod which comes with the game.
- **Advanced.** Even harder.
- **Expert.** Reccommended for experienced players.
- **Challenge.** Still playable.
- **Impossible.** Even don't try this.

## Custom difficulty
Allows tuning of each difficulty factor.
- Construction cost (for roads and for everything else)
- Maintenance cost (for roads and for everything else)
- Demand offset and multiplier (calculated by formula (Demand - Offset) * Multiplier)
- Area cost multiplier
- Refund percentage
- Addition money at the game start
- Relocation cost multiplier
- Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Office level up requirements as well as limits for the "land value too low" complains.

## Additional features
- Unlock purchasing all 25 tiles, when the last milestone is reached.
- Unlock the "build basic road" milestone from the beginning.
- 100% refund from recently built roads at all difficulty levels.

## Mods compatibility
- Extended building information mod: the level up progress bars isn't accurate because the level up requirements is modified.
- Using together with any mod that changes costs, level up requirements, or demand, may cause game balance issues.
