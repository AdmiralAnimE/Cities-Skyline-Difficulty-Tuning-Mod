# Cities Skyline: Difficulty Tuning Mod

## Difficulty Levels
- **Easy.** Easier than vanilla. All costs are halved. Upkeep decreased by 25%. ₡200,000 at start. Level up requirements decreased. Demand almost never drops to zero.
- **Normal.** Almost the same as vanilla.
- **Medium.** A little harder than vanilla.
- **Hard.** Close to the Hard Mod which comes with the game.
- **Advanced.** Even harder.
- **Expert.** Recommended for experienced players.
- **Challenge.** Very accurate city planning required.
- **Impossible.** Near the limit of playability. More money at the start to help surviving. (Added a screenshot to demonstrate that the difficulty "Impossible" is playable.)
- **Custom.** A lot of customizable parameters.

## Special Difficulty Levels
These special levels are made for fun and experimenting. Use it at your own risk :)
- **Free.** Construction is free. Upkeep is halved. Demand is always 100%. Land value and service score are not required to be high for buildings levelup (education is still required). Starting money is 0.
- **₡500,000.** Normal difficulty with ₡500,000 at start.
- **Demand!!!.** Demand is always 100%. Other settings are normal.
- **Oppression.** Impossible difficulty with free construction cost. Still hard but less waiting time.
- **Public transport.** Normal difficulty. Zero cost and upkeep for public transport.
- **Low city.** Levelup requirements are set so high that buildings will never levelup (probably). Normal difficulty.
- **Free relocation.** Building relocation cost is free. Normal difficulty.

Difficulty settings are available from the Main Menu.
Main Menu > Options > Mods Settings > Difficulty Tuning Mod

Changing difficulty options during a game is possible, but cost values displayed in info panels will not update until reloading the game.
Better to exit to the Main Menu, change the difficulty options, and load the game again.

## Custom difficulty
Allows tuning of each difficulty factor.
- Construction and upkeep cost (separate for service buildings, public transportation, roads and for everything else)
- Demand offset and multiplier. Calculated by formula (Demand + Offset) * Multiplier
- Relocation cost multiplier
- Area cost multiplier
- Start money amount
- Reward percentage (amount of money you get when a milestone is reached)
- Land value requirements for level up of Residential and Commercial buildings.
- Service score requirements for level up of Industrial and Office buildings.

When you change a difficulty factor, the game difficulty is automatically set to "Custom".
When switching back to the Custom difficulty, your previously set custom settings are restored.

## Additional features
- Unlock purchasing all 25 area tiles, when the last milestone is reached.
- Unlock the "Basic Road Created" milestone from the beginning.
- 100% refund from recently built roads at all difficulty levels.
- Steam achievements are enabled for all difficulty levels except Easy and Custom.

## Mod compatibility
- Extended building info mod: the level up progress bars isn't accurate because the level up requirements is modified.
- Using together with any mod that changes costs, level up requirements, or demand, may cause game balance issues.

After Dark compatible.
