# Cities-Skyline-Difficulty-Tuning-Mod

Eight levels of difficulty. Separate tuning of each difficulty factor.

No changes in the gameplay, except costs, demand, and level up requirements.

Difficulty level and other custom parameters can be set in the game options.
If during a game, exit to the Main Menu, change the difficulty options, and load the game again.

## Difficulty Levels
- **Easy.** Easier than vanilla. All costs halved. Free relocation of the service buildings. Level up requirements decreased. Demand almost never drops to zero.
- **Normal.** The same as vanilla.
- **Medium.** Just a little harder than vanilla.
- **Hard.** Close to the Hard Mod which comes with the game.
- **Advanced.** Even harder.
- **Expert.** Recommended for experienced players.
- **Challenge.** Very accurate city planning required.
- **Impossible.** Near the limit of playability. More money at the start to help surviving. (Added a screenshot to demonstrate that the difficulty "Impossible" is playable.)

For detailed parameters of each level, see the custom difficulty options. Values are ordered from "Easy" to "Impossible".

## Custom difficulty
Allows tuning of each difficulty factor.
- Construction cost (for roads and for everything else)
- Maintenance cost (for roads and for everything else)
- Demand offset and multiplier. Calculated by formula (Demand - Offset) * Multiplier
- Area cost multiplier
- Refund percentage
- Relocation cost multiplier
- Land value requirements for level up of Residential and Commercial buildings.
- Service score requirements for level up of Industrial and Office buildings.

## Additional features
- Unlock purchasing all 25 area tiles, when the last milestone is reached.
- Unlock the "Basic Road Created" milestone from the beginning.
- 100% refund from recently built roads at all difficulty levels.
- Steam achievements are enabled for all difficulty levels except Easy and Custom.

## Mod compatibility
- Extended building info mod: the level up progress bars isn't accurate because the level up requirements is modified.
- Using together with any mod that changes costs, level up requirements, or demand, may cause game balance issues.
