Difficulty settings are available from the Main Menu.
Main Menu > Options > Mods Settings > Difficulty Tuning Mod

Changing difficulty options during a game is possible, but cost values displayed in the info panels will not update until reloading the game. Better to exit to the Main Menu, change the difficulty options, and load the game again.

## Customizable parameters
- Construction and upkeep cost (separate for service buildings, public transportation, roads and for everything else)
- Demand offset and multiplier. Calculated by formula (Demand + Offset) * Multiplier
- Ground and noise pollution radius
- Relocation cost multiplier
- Area cost multiplier
- Reward percentage (amount of money you get when a milestone is reached)
- Start money amount
- Loan amount
- Population required to unlock milestones
- Land value requirements for level up of Residential and Commercial buildings
- Service score requirements for level up of Industrial and Office buildings

When you change a difficulty parameter, the game difficulty is automatically set to "Custom".

## Additional features
- Unlock purchasing all 25 area tiles, when the last milestone is reached. (The area cost is affected in this mod.)
- Unlock the "Basic Road Created" milestone from the beginning. (This is very minor thing that removes the requirement to build a piece of two-lane road before building somethin else.)
- 100% refund from recently built roads at all difficulty levels. (Consider it as an "undo" feature for roads.)
- Steam achievements are enabled for all difficulty levels except Easy and Free. (Yes. You can get achievemets with this mod.)
